## Kriyaetive

Kriyaetive is an independent research and technology lab exploring open tools for creators, communities, and local-first systems.

We design lightweight, decentralized frameworks that prioritize autonomy, collaboration, and creative freedom — building software that works with people, not around them.

⸻

✦ What We Believe
	•	Creativity is foundational
Tools should expand imagination — not narrow it.
	•	Openness enables trust
Open protocols and transparent development invite resilience, collaboration, and shared ownership.
	•	Local-first, network-aware
Systems should run on user devices and scale across peer networks — not rely on centralized platforms.

⸻

✦ What We’re Building
	•	d-verse
A modular, peer-to-peer framework for building local-first applications that work offline and sync across trusted peers.
	•	Developer Tools
Command-line utilities, interpreters, and libraries for executing logic, syncing state, and building networked applications without external dependencies.
	•	Infrastructure experiments
From embedded runtimes to lightweight messaging protocols — all designed for constrained, real-world environments.

⸻

✦ Our Vision

To help shape a digital future rooted in creativity, autonomy, and self-governance — not cloud lock-in or platform dependency.

⸻

✦ Our Mission

To build intuitive, interoperable, and ethical tools that empower people to create, collaborate, and connect on their own terms.

⸻

We’re building in the open — and always looking for thoughtful collaborators.
Whether it’s ideas, feedback, or code, we’d love to hear from you.
